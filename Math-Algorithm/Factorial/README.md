# Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The factorial of `n` also equals the product of `n` with the next smaller factorial:

```
 n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1
    = n * (n - 1)
```

 ### For example:

 ```
      3! = 3 * 2! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
```
