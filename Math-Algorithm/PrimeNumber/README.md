# Prime Factors

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.

If we **can** make it by multiplying other whole numbers it is a **Composite Number**.

**Prime factors** are those [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) which multiply together to give the original number. For example `39` will have prime factors of `3` and `13` which are also prime numbers. Another example is `15` whose prime factors are `3` and `5`.
